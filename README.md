# 202-FCC-Front-End-Development-Libraries-jQUERY

jQuery is one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries in the world.

Before jQuery was released in 2016, all major browsers handled JavaScript slightly differently. 
jQuery accomplished 2 things. 
    1) It simplified the process of writing client-side JavaScript 
    2) It ensured that your code worked the same way in all browsers

In this project, we can learn how to use jQuery to "select", "remove", "clone", and "modify" different elements on the page.
